Just a small town girl
Livin in a lonely world
She took the midnight train going anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere
A singer in a smokey room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waitin
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin in the night
Streetlights people
Livin just to find emotion
Hidin somewhere in the night
